# OutdoorScienceLab
For my Eagle Project, I designed and built an Outdoor Science Lab for an elementary school. This project can be replicated by any other Scout or any school and will become a great addition to science learning. I decided to make this project open source, because I hope to encourage more teachers and students to explore science.
